# CC_Fraud_detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project using Machine Learning and R concepts, In this R Project, I performed detection of credit cards. I went through the various algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, I made use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.
I've added the graphs and the code
